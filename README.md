# sktp-server
SKTP Server for Commodore 64

PHP application that allows to generate web based text screens for Commodore 64/128 (and Plus/4) and allows user interaction (keyboard, joystick) via Sidekick64 with network kernel or WiC64 (with specific sktp-client, see below). It sends URLs for launchable Payload (PRG, CRT, D64, etc.) to the network expansion for "Remote Code Execution" on the Commodore 64 (desired, not a security issue in this case ;) ).

SKTP stands for "Sidekick64 Transfer Protocol". The server and client talk via this simple binary protocol on top of HTTP.

The sktp-server is only useful with sktp-clients. Three different clients exist at this time:
* The C/C++ client within the Sidekick64 network kernel. This was the first client existing and is still the main client: https://github.com/hpingel/Sidekick64
* The Javascript client (which ist part of sktp-server sources. It is useful for development, testing and debugging.
* A new sktp-client in assembly language that can be used with the WiC64 at the moment but it might also become usable with the Sidekick64 network kernel: https://github.com/hpingel/sktp-client

More documentation will be added on demand (maybe :-)).

# SKTP-Apps 

The sktp-server may ask different "apps" with different purposes. Existing apps are:
* "Petscii experiments" - Test screens that illustrate the different options to compose the screen content 
* CSDB Browser/Launcher (sourcecode not yet public at this time)
* HVSC Browser/Launcher (sourcecode not yet public at this time)
* RSS-Feed-Reader (sourcecode not yet public at this time)
* "Arena-App" (Multiuser Mini-Game + Chat) (sourcecode not yet public at this time)
* Launcher for the Kick-WebApp (mobile app for touch devices) (sourcecode not yet public at this time)
* Main menu (lists all other apps)
